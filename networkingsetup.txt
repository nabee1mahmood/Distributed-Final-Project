To allow the nginx server and cluster to communicate with each other:
docker network connect couchnet nginx-nginx-1
docker network connect couchnet nginx-php-1

This adds all 3 containers to the docker network that is
hosting the cluster, making the cluster reachable from the
nginx containers.

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NGINX SETUP:
Run:
docker exec <containername-nginx-1> nginx -s reload
docker restart <containername-nginx-1>

this is because of the updated config to account for pouchdb
