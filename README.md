# Distributed CouchDB NoSQL Cluster

### Introduction
This was a final project in our distributed system course where the goal was to create a distributed system using OpenSuSE Linux,x and each team was given a NoSQL system,m and we had to use CRUD operations (Create, Read, Upate and Delete) to easily 


### Tools and Technologies Used
- Docker:
- PouchDB: (used for offline storage)
- NGINX (used for the web server to direct when an operation was requested to send it to the correct container



### Report 



### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a distributed NoSQL system using CouchDB. A multi-node CouchDB cluster was deployed using Docker, with high availability, horizontal scalability, and multi-master replication. An NGINX web server was configured to act as a single access point and load balancer for the cluster, while a web-based CRUD application was used to interact with the database.
